TRACK : Empowering upon innovation

## The Main Idea

InnoWaste project focuses on management of household and public waste. This idea will motivate the people to save the solid waste and give them for recycling, thus saving the environment from pollution.




## Why InnoWaste?
Consider you have a threshold amount of waste with you, what innowaste can do is get any type of solid dry waste from you and in exchange the user gets points , these points can be used to purchase our eco-friendly merchandise, discount coupons with  collaborations and empowering recycling of the household waste , that didn't used to go at the right place or didnâ€™t used to recycle at a good capacity.
Next to this Innowaste has a space where people can achieve badges from doing environment friendly things and sharing them with their peers which also motivates others to do such activities.
InnoWaste provide platform for managing waste from big events.
